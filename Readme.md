# 👋 Hi, My name is **Keshav Dulal**

I am a Frontend Software Engineer who enjoys building things for web. I specialize in building Frontend of Web applications, while I ocassionally dabble around backend and game development.

I have experienc building React & Node JS Applications for American Health Care Companies & Educational Institutions. I enjoy working in a team and making innovative products.

This is the 4th iteration of my [portfolio site](Keshavdulal.com.np).

## Purpose of making another portfolio site

Making portfolio is fun sometimes and sometimes a total pain. I am planning to put nail on the coffin for the latter half atleast by sharing my approach to making a portfolio site and making it available to the community.

## Development Roadmap

### First Phase 🚲

- [x] Project Setup
- [x] Preliminary Content
- [x] Responsive Site Design
- [x] Initial Soft Launch via Netlify

### Second Phase ⛵️

- [ ] Night Mode
- [ ] Blog Integration
- [ ] PWA Perhaps 🤷‍♂️
- [ ] Seamless Scroll

### Third Phase 🚀

- [ ] Make it modular for Open Source Usage

#### The site takes inspiration from portfolio site of [Brittney Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/) & [Avantika](https://avanthikameenakshi.com/).
